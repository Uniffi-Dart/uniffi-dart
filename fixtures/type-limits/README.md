The u64 cases exercise generated bindings against Rust, including the upper half
of the unsigned range. They run as part of the normal workspace test suite:

```sh
cargo test -p type_limits
```

To keep the generated package and run the same cases under JIT and AOT:

```sh
UNIFFI_DART_TEST_DIR="$PWD/target/u64-test-output" cargo test -p type_limits -- --nocapture
```

The test prints its generated package directory. In that directory:

```sh
dart run test/u64_cases.dart
dart build cli --target=test/u64_cases.dart --output=build/u64-probe
./build/u64-probe/bundle/bin/u64_cases
```

`dart build cli` bundles the native library through the package's build hook.
Keep the bundle together when running it on another machine with the same OS and
architecture. `dart compile exe` alone does not bundle the native asset.

The cases include scalar boundaries, 1,000 deterministic values, byte offsets,
range/type rejection before a Rust function is entered, checked int conversion,
unchanged smaller integer types, defaults, nullable values, nested lists/maps,
record and enum construction, custom aliases, objects, synchronous and async
callbacks, and invalid callback results. The standalone runner uses explicit
checks, so AOT does not depend on assertions being enabled.

The component also exports a record named `BigInt`. All cases run with that
record present, so scalar and nested u64 types, defaults, aliases and callbacks
must continue to refer to Dart's built-in `BigInt`. The record's own name and
full-width u64 field must survive a native round trip.
