## Work status

Reference: [TODOs](./TODO.md)

## MSRV: 1.1.70

This project must always work on latest stable rust + version before. We are also testing it against 1.1.70.0 , which we consider the Minimum Support Rust Version (MSRV) at this point. Rust lower than that will probably not compile the project.

## Integration Tests

The original command is the following:

```
cargo nextest run --all --nocapture
```

If you want to test only the specific module, please use the following command:

```
cargo nextest run -p hello_world --nocapture
```

`genco` is based on `proc_macro_span`, so if you want fully functional whitespace detection, you must build and run projects using `genco` with a nightly compiler until `proc-macro2` is stablized.

```
cargo +nightly nextest run -p hello_world --nocapture
```

The project is building on top of the great work of Mozillas UniFFI, with inspirations from other external frontends (like Kotlin and Go) and with the help of the [ffi-gen](https://github.com/acterglobal/ffi-gen) lib. Thanks folks!
